# Let there be light!

## Instructions

1. Have Ruby.
2. Do not be without Ruby.
3. Clone the repo down into a folder -- location doesn't matter.
4. Be on the network you want to monitor.
5. Update the IPs, colors etc.
6. Have [Philips Hue](http://meethue.com/).
7. Plug in the hub, configure all the things via the mobile App, etc.
8. Change the ID in the script to whatever your new lightbulb IDs are.
9. Run the script.

It's really easy. The code base is small. The time put into this was minimal. Overall cost was probably just under $200.00. Time was like... 15 minutes.

## Context

Ok, me and the guys were rambling one day -- the internet was slow. Then it was down. Then it was slow. Then for 5 seconds it was cool. Then it went down again.

Our ISP overlords are cool.

Anyway -- I didn't want to keep checking if I could do work. We talked about ideas, auto notification scripts, etc.

Really we just wanted something visual.

Soooo I wrote this.
